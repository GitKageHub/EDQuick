# EDQuick: Management Scripts for Elite Dangerous

> The operational framework of this project is predicated upon a self-contained methodology, thereby precluding the necessity for external cooperative entities.

This repository constitutes a comprehensive collection of scripts and configuration files designated for the automated management of Elite Dangerous companion applications. The primary objective is the enhancement of multi-commander operational efficiency through systemic automation.

## ðŸŽ® Project Mandate: Automated Fleet Administration

The contemporaneous administration of four distinct commander profiles necessitates a robust and efficient management infrastructure. The scripts and configurations contained herein serve as the operational mechanism for this purpose. The core objectives of this initiative are defined as follows:

* To effectuate the automated installation and updating of all designated Elite Dangerous companion applications.

* To manage and maintain the configuration parameters of said applications across multiple instances.

* To ensure operational isolation and system stability through the implementation of Sandboxie-Plus technology.

* To maintain stringent version control over all proprietary scripts and configurations.

### ðŸŒŒ Justification for Sandboxie-Plus

The concurrent operation of multiple commander profiles requires a mechanism for the prevention of inter-application conflict. The utilization of Sandboxie-Plus facilitates the creation of isolated, secure environments, thereby ensuring the stability and integrity of each individual application instance.

### ðŸ’¡ Utilization & Adaptability

This repository has been developed primarily for the author's personal use. However, its contents are made available to the public and may prove advantageous to other commanders. It is to be noted that the configurations herein are tailored to a specific operational environment and, as such, may require modification to conform to disparate user systems.
