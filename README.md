# EDQuick: Management Scripts for Elite Dangerous

> The operational framework of this project is predicated upon a self-contained methodology, thereby precluding the necessity for external cooperative entities.

This repository constitutes a comprehensive collection of scripts and configuration files designated for the automated management of Elite Dangerous companion applications. The primary objective is the enhancement of multi-commander operational efficiency through systemic automation.

## 🎮 Project Mandate: Automated Fleet Administration

The contemporaneous administration of four distinct commander profiles necessitates a robust and efficient management infrastructure. The scripts and configurations contained herein serve as the operational mechanism for this purpose. The core objectives of this initiative are defined as follows:

* To effectuate the automated installation and updating of all designated Elite Dangerous companion applications.

* To manage and maintain the configuration parameters of said applications across multiple instances.

* To ensure operational isolation and system stability through the implementation of Sandboxie-Plus technology.

* To maintain stringent version control over all proprietary scripts and configurations.

### 🌌 Justification for Sandboxie-Plus

The concurrent operation of multiple commander profiles requires a mechanism for the prevention of inter-application conflict. The utilization of Sandboxie-Plus facilitates the creation of isolated, secure environments, thereby ensuring the stability and integrity of each individual application instance.

### 💡 Utilization & Adaptability
